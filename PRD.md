# Azure AKS Documentation Tracker

A web application that monitors and summarizes meaningful changes to the Azure AKS documentation repository, filtering out noise and providing valuable insights for developers and administrators.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Professional** - Clean, enterprise-grade interface that instills confidence in data accuracy
2. **Efficient** - Quick scanning of updates with clear categorization and smart filtering
3. **Informative** - Rich context and impact analysis that helps users understand change significance

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Handles API integration, data processing, filtering, and persistent storage while maintaining focused functionality around documentation tracking

## Essential Features

### GitHub API Integration
- **Functionality**: Fetches recent commits from MicrosoftDocs/azure-aks-docs repository
- **Purpose**: Provides real-time access to documentation changes for analysis
- **Trigger**: Manual refresh button or automatic periodic updates
- **Progression**: User clicks refresh → API call initiated → Commits fetched → Data processed → Updates displayed
- **Success criteria**: Successfully retrieves commit data including SHA, date, author, message, files, and diffs

### Intelligent Commit Filtering
- **Functionality**: Filters out noise commits (typos, grammar, bot merges, formatting)
- **Purpose**: Focuses attention on substantive documentation changes that matter to users
- **Trigger**: Automatically applied during data processing after API fetch
- **Progression**: Raw commits received → Filter rules applied → Noise commits excluded → Meaningful commits retained
- **Success criteria**: Excludes commits with keywords like 'typo', 'grammar', 'Acrolinx', merge commits, and bot authors

### Smart Commit Grouping
- **Functionality**: Combines related commits touching same files or similar messages on same day
- **Purpose**: Reduces duplicate entries and provides consolidated view of changes
- **Trigger**: Automatically applied during commit processing
- **Progression**: Filtered commits → Grouping analysis → Related commits merged → Consolidated updates created
- **Success criteria**: Multiple related commits appear as single logical update with earliest date and latest SHA

### Metadata Extraction & Enhancement
- **Functionality**: Derives title, category, URL, summary, and impact from commit data
- **Purpose**: Provides rich context and categorization for each documentation change
- **Trigger**: Applied to each processed commit group
- **Progression**: Commit group → File analysis → Metadata extraction → Summary generation → Enhanced update object
- **Success criteria**: Each update has meaningful title, accurate category, working URL, and informative summary/impact

### Update Dashboard
- **Functionality**: Displays processed updates in chronological list with filtering/sorting
- **Purpose**: Provides clear overview of recent documentation changes with easy access
- **Trigger**: User visits app or refreshes data
- **Progression**: User opens app → Stored updates loaded → List rendered → User browses/filters → User clicks links
- **Success criteria**: Updates display with all metadata, links work, sorting/filtering functions properly

## Edge Case Handling

- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff and display appropriate user feedback
- **Network Failures**: Show error states with retry options and cached data fallback
- **Empty Results**: Display helpful empty state when no meaningful updates found
- **Malformed Commits**: Skip commits with missing required fields and log for debugging
- **Large Diffs**: Truncate extremely large diffs while preserving essential information
- **Invalid File Paths**: Handle edge cases in URL generation with fallback behaviors

## Design Direction

The design should feel professional and enterprise-focused, similar to GitHub's documentation or Microsoft's developer portals, emphasizing clarity and information density over visual flair.

## Color Selection

Complementary color scheme using professional blues and grays with strategic accent colors for categorization and status indication.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Cool Gray (oklch(0.65 0.02 240)) for subtle backgrounds and Light Gray (oklch(0.95 0.01 240)) for containers
- **Accent Color**: Orange (oklch(0.65 0.18 45)) - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and important status indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray #F8F9FA): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 7.2:1 ✓
  - Card (White #FFFFFF): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Deep Blue): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 6.8:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Cool Gray): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Clean, highly legible sans-serif typefaces that convey technical precision and professional authority, similar to those used in enterprise documentation.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Update Titles): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Section Headers): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Labels (Categories/Dates): Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing
  - Code (SHAs/Paths): JetBrains Mono/14px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle, functional animations that enhance information processing without distracting from content consumption, focusing on state transitions and data loading feedback.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates data freshness, loading states, and content relationships
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Refresh button gets prominent animation, update cards have subtle hover states, category badges animate on filter changes

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Cards for update entries, Badges for categories, Button for refresh action, Skeleton for loading states, Alert for errors, Separator for grouping, Table for detailed view option
- **Customizations**: Custom category badge colors, specialized commit SHA display component, enhanced card layout for update metadata
- **States**: Refresh button (loading/ready), update cards (default/hover), category filters (active/inactive), error alerts (warning/error)
- **Icon Selection**: RefreshCw for update action, ExternalLink for documentation links, GitCommit for commit references, Calendar for dates, Tag for categories
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4/6/8/12/16px spacing using Tailwind scale with generous padding in cards
- **Mobile**: Stack update metadata vertically, hide less critical information, ensure touch-friendly button sizes, responsive card layouts
